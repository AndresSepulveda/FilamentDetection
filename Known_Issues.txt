1)
The code can present a large sensitivity on the results, 
depending on the choosen parameters and the filament detection criteria
(magnitude of velocity vs sst gradient). Compare your results from
the automatic method with your own selection of filaments using
the manual selection method (GUI for assisted selection).

2)
Intense coastal currents can be incorrectly identified as filaments. 
A solution for this issue is being developed.
