The fdt_automatic code was tested with results from 

Cordeiro, N.G., Nolasco, R., Cordeiro‚ÄêPires, A., Barton, E.D. and Dubert, J., 2015. Filaments 
on the Western Iberian Margin: A modeling study. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 
120(8), pp.5400-5416.

As it is shown, coastal currents are detected as filaments using the velocity magnitude critera.
A solution to this is being developed.
